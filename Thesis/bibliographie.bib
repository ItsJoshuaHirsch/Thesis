 abstract = {Introduction These guidelines on paediatric life support are based on three main principles: (1) the incidence of critical illness, particularly cardiopulmonary arrest, and injury in children is much lower than in adults; (2) the illnesses and pathophysiological responses of paediatric patients often differ from those seen in adults; (3) many paediatric emergencies are managed primarily by providers who are not paediatric specialists and who have limited paediatric emergency medical experience. Therefore, guidelines on paediatric life support must incorporate the best available scientific evidence but must also be simple and feasible. Finally, international guidelines need to acknowledge the variation in national and local emergency medical infrastructures and allow flexibility when necessary.},
