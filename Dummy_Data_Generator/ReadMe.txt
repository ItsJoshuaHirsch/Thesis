-> Working with Python 3.7, older Versions not tested yet.

By first time using this tool, you have to execute the install.bat first, this will install all required python modules.


After completion of the Installation, you can run "Generate.bat" from the CMD and pass a parameter, which will be the desired number of random generated Missions.

Syntax:
	Generate.bat [NumberOfMissions]



After executing it, the Tool will generate the exact number of random Missions with all available CPU-Cores in the Background.

You will receive a JSON-File called "mp_missions[NumberOfMissions/1000]k.json" in the same directory as the "Generate.bat" file

 
Note:	1 Mio. Missions will take roughly 5 Minutes, so be patient :)
Tip:	zip the JSON-File for a File 1/9-sized
